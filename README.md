Quality of life mod for Caves of Qud which adds autodisassemble option. Highly effective against folding chairs.

## Features

- Adds autoscrap toggle to all items that can be disassembled
- With autoscrap enabled, that item type is treated as scrap and disassembled on pickup
- Respects the "Auto-pickup scrap" option

## Limitations

- It doesn't work on things you can't pick up, such as hyperbiotic chairs
